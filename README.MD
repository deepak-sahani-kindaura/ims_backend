# 📘 Inventory Management System (IMS)

This Django-based Inventory Management System (IMS) is a scalable, multi-tenant backend application built to manage inventory operations across  multiple tenants. It supports fine-grained access control, optimized API routing, and production-ready deployment with Docker and Nginx.

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python 3.12+

- 🐳 Docker 28.2+

- 🧱 Docker Compose v2.24+

- 🌐 Git 2.25+

- 🗃️ SQLite 3.45+

- ⚡ Memcached 1.6+

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

After installing the prerequisites, follow the steps below to get your project running using Docker:

```bash
# 1️⃣ Start Docker containers (build & run in detached mode)
sudo docker-compose up --build -d

# 2️⃣ Get a bash shell inside the running container
docker exec -it <container_name_or_id> bash

# 3️⃣ Run database migrations
python manage.py migrate

# 4️⃣ Load initial data using a custom Django command
python manage.py load_data
```

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🏢 **Tenant-wise Database Configuration**:
Seamless support for both **shared** and **isolated** databases. Each tenant can configure their own database strategy.
  - Tenants can operate on:
    - A **shared RDBMS database**, or
    - **Isolated databases** per Tenant
    - 🔌 **Database Backend is Pluggable**: Easily extend support for **NoSQL databases** (e.g. MongoDB) or other RDBMS by abstracting DB access layer.

----

- 🔐 **Tenant-wise Configurable Authentication and Authorization**
  Each tenant can independently choose the authentication strategy:
  - **JWT-based authentication**
  - **Token-based authentication**
  - 🔌 **Pluggable Design**: Easily extendable to integrate other mechanisms like **SAML SSO**, **OAuth2**, or **LDAP** as needed.
  - Fine-grained access control where each API endpoint can be enabled or restricted per role, allowing admins to dynamically assign permissions to roles.

----

- ⚡ **Tenant-aware Caching**: Support for in-memory and Memcached caching with tenant-specific keys for isolated performance. A unified caching interface abstracts the underlying cache system, with current support for:
  - **In-memory cache**
  - **Memcached**
  - 🔌 Additional backends (like Redis) can be plugged in easily by extending the interface

----

- 🌐 **Subdomain-Based Tenant Identification**
  Every request is dynamically routed to the correct tenant using a custom middleware:
  - Extracts the **subdomain** from the incoming request
  - Fetches **tenant metadata** from cache or DB
  - Binds tenant info to a **thread-local context**
  - Automatically rejects invalid or unknown subdomains with a `400 Bad Request`

  ✅ Smart behavior:
  - Excludes specific routes (like health checks or login) using path-exclusion logic
  - Tenant-aware state is auto-cleared after each request for thread safety

  🔄 *Cached Tenant Resolution
  Uses caching (like Memcached) to speed up tenant lookup on repeated requests.*

----

- 🧱 **Generic CRUD BaseView**
  Build the custom **generic CRUD view class** that handles all standard Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations with minimal boilerplate.
  Just inherit `BaseView` and plug in:
  - Your `serializer_class`
  - Your `db-access layer`

  ✅ Supports:
  - `search_fields` for full-text search
  - `filter_fields` for field-based filtering
  - `is_pagination = True` to enable built-in paginated responses

  🔧 You can override any method for full customization, making it a powerful foundation for rapid API development.

----

- 🚨 **Centralized Exception Middleware**
  All unhandled exceptions in the API pipeline are caught and transformed into structured JSON responses.

  ✅ Features:
  - Logs full traceback details using a centralized logger
  - Converts DRF `ValidationError` into frontend-friendly JSON with detailed formatting
  - Handles custom application exceptions like:
    - `NoDataFoundError`
    - `BadRequestError`
    - `PermissionDenied`
    - `UnauthorizedException`
    - `WrongCredentialsException`
  - Returns consistent error codes and messages using the shared `utils.messages` and `utils.exceptions.codes`

  🛡 Ensures even unexpected errors return a proper **500 Internal Server Error** response with a structured payload — no raw stack traces exposed to the client.

----

- ⏱ **Performance & Version Middleware**
  Automatically adds useful diagnostic metadata to every API response.

  📦 Headers Added:
  - `Version`: Application version (from `get_version_str()`)
  - `Req-Performance-Time`: Time taken to process the request
    Example: `0:00:00.023456 [HH:MM:SS:MS] | 23.456[MS]`

  🔧 Useful for:
  - Debugging latency issues
  - CI/CD version traceability
  - Frontend debugging without needing separate instrumentation

----

- 🐞 **Logging**: Custom `log_msg` utility that logs with function context, reference data, and emoji-level markers in local Linux environments.

  - 🛑 **Print Statement Control**
  Disable all `print()` statements project-wide (excluding virtual environments) using a single toggle in your config. To force to use the logger:
  - `DISABLE_PRINT = true` → Suppresses all print calls
  - `DISABLE_PRINT = false` → Allows print statements (default for development)

  - 📜 **Audit Logs**: Capture every API request post-authentication, including method, path, user, and more.

----

- 📄 **Environment Configuration via JSON**
  Custom environment variables are loaded from a centralized `env.json` file using a helper function (`load_env()`), enabling:
  - Clean separation of config from code
  - Easier environment overrides for local/dev/prod/Docker

  These features offer maximum flexibility for multitenant deployments while maintaining centralized control.

----

- 🌍 **CORS Support**:
  Fully configured **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing** for seamless frontend-backend integration.
  ✅ By default, CORS is open to all origins (`CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS = True`) for development convenience.
  🔧 This can be restricted by setting `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in environment-specific configuration for production.

----

- 📤 **Unified Response Format**: All API responses follow a consistent structure using a centralized `generate_response` utility.

----

- 🌐 **Tenant-aware Swagger/OpenAPI Docs**: Auto-generated API docs that dynamically reflect only the endpoints accessible to the current tenant.

----

- 🐳 **Docker**: Full Docker setup with `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and volume mapping for multi-DB support (e.g. SQLite or pluggable RDBMS).

----

- 🧭 **Nginx as Reverse Proxy**: Production-ready Nginx configuration routing traffic to Gunicorn securely and efficiently.
